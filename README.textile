your own app by following these integration instructions.

h2. Integration Instructions

# Download the file @RegisterWithCrowdMob.java@.  (https://raw.github.com/crowdmob/installs-android/master/src/com/crowdmob/installs/RegisterWithCrowdMob.java)
# Copy the file @RegisterWithCrowdMob.java@ into the same directory containing your main Android app activity.  (Usually something like: @YourApp/src/com/yourcompany/yourapp@)
# Edit the file @RegisterWithCrowdMob.java@, and change the package from @com.crowdmob.installs@ to the package containing your main app activity.  (Usually something like: @com.yourcompany.yourapp@)
# Edit your main activity class.
## Add a class-level constant for your app's secret key.  (Like: @private static final String SECRET_KEY = "d2ef7da8a45891f2fee33747788903e7";@)
## Add a class-level constant for your app's permalink.  (Like: @private static final String PERMALINK = "your-app";@)
## At the very bottom of your @onCreate()@ method, call the code to register your app&rsquo;s install with CrowdMob: @RegisterWithCrowdMob.trackAppInstallation(this, SECRET_KEY, PERMALINK);@
## Confirm your work against this example main activity class: https://github.com/crowdmob/installs-android/blob/master/src/com/crowdmob/installs/InstallsAndroidActivity.java
# Congratulations!  You&rsquo;ve integrated your Android app with MobDeals to track installs.
